                                        <p>Prevention of diseases, especially lifestyle diseases and heart attacks, is our passion. The right medication and lifestyle modification can prevent, limit and control heart diseases. Our aim is to educate the public on this.</p>

                    <p>Our Primary Mission is to prevent the onset of lifestyle diseases. Foremost amongst these diseases are ‘Heart Attacks’, which are almost always predictable and preventable. Proper screening, medical treatment and suitable advice on lifestyle modifications with regular follow-ups can prevent, limit and control heart diseases. Unfortunately, 99% of all people (including many healthcare professionals!) are unaware of this fact.</p>

                    <p>Physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol can be controlled by early detection and can be prevented before they cause heart attacks, strokes, kidney failures and even some cancers. We invite you to visit us for regular health checkups.</p>
                    <p>We believe that spreading awareness is an absolute requirement for health improvement; and that health education would be more effective if we educated the educators. That’s why we’re proud to say that Venkataeswara Hospitals is recognised as a Centre of Excellence for offering several paramedical courses.</p>

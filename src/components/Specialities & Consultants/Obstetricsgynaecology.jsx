                                        <p>Women often neglect their own health as they care for others. As Venkataeswara Hospitals prioritises preventive healthcare, we recommend that women meet a gynaecologist on a regular basis, whether or not they feel there is an immediate need to do so, in order to prevent disease and stay healthy.</p>

Nine months is a long time – and yet as parents watch a small clump of cells grow into a foetus, into their son or daughter, they may wonder how the three trimesters passed so swiftly!</p>

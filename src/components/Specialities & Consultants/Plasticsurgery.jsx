                                        <p>Plastic surgery is a branch of medicine dealing with reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries. Reconstructive surgery rectifies any loss of skin, loss of external structures or genetic deformities. Cosmetic surgery, on the other hand, beautifies the normal physical structure, to defy the impact of age.</p>
                                        <p>The Plastic Surgery Department at Venkataeswara Hospitals works on aesthetic surgeries based on the needs of the patient, as well as extensive or minor reconstructive surgeries.</p>

                    <p>Reconstructive surgery could be indicated for patients who were the victims of significant or substantial accidents, especially when the impact is clearly visible on the face or skin.</p>
                    <p>Cosmetic Surgery deals with non-surgical procedures, like botox, filler and resurfacing to improve the patientâ€™s facial appearance.</p>
                    <p>Various surgical cosmetic procedures could also be performed. Liposuction improves the shape of the body, and should not be mistaken for a treatment for obesity. Tummy tucks are performed to remove excess tummy skin. Gynaecomastia (enlarged breasts) in males can be reduced by liposuction and gland excision. Breast size can be reduced or increased. Surgical procedures for the eyelids, cheeks and nose to change the shape of the face can also be undertaken.</p>

                    <p>There are many specialisations within the field of plastic surgery. Some physicians specialise in cleft lip and palate rectification. Others could specialise in craniofacial surgery, hand surgery & microsurgery, burn care & reconstruction, and cosmetic surgery.</p>
                    <p>The cleft lip and palate is one of the most common and visible physical congenital deformities. Multidisciplinary care is required to tackle the appearance, dental and speech issues of cleft infants and children.</p>
                    <p>All required equipment and facilities for safe plastic surgery procedures are available at Venkataeswara Hospitals.</p>

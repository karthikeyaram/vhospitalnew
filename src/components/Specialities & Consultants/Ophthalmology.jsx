                    <p>The Ophthalmology Department at Venkataeswara Hospitals treats patients suffering from disorders or injuries of the eye, such as eye infections, cataracts, conjunctivitis, glaucoma, retinopathy, vision impairment, astigmatism, styes and nystagmus.</p>
                    <p>Visit an ophthalmologist if you are suffering from distorted vision, double vision, excess tearing, bulging of the eye, decreased vision, eyelid abnormalities, family history of eye disease, injury to the eye, loss of peripheral vision, misaligned eyes, pain in the eye, red eye, etc.</p>

                    <p>Optometrists and opticians are also trained to provide care for the eyes, especially relating to correcting refractive issues and prescribing spectacles and contact lenses. However, there’s much more to eye health than “power”. Ophthalmologists are trained in the medical care of the ocular system, including all other parts of the eye. Stay focused on your vision and meet an ophthalmologist if you observe any unexpected changes that occur in and around your eyes.</p>
                    <p>Many of these eye diseases, disorders and injuries are treated through surgical methods. In addition, LASIK eye surgery can also be performed to correct near- or far-sightedness.</p>

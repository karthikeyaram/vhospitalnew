                                        <p>One of the common reasons people walk into a doctorâ€™s office for a consultation is to diagnose and cure recurrent attacks of the common cold! Many nasal allergies and cold-like symptoms could lead on to the development of Bronchitis and Asthma, especially when poorly controlled or treated. Our team of ENT Surgeons provides surgical treatment when indicated.</p>

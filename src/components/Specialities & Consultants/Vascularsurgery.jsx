                    <p>Vascular surgeons in Venkataeswara Hospitals are trained to treat diseases and disorders of the vascular/circulatory system. For example, they regularly treat conditions like hardening of the arteries, which could obstruct the flow of blood within the body.</p>
                    <p>Our vascular surgeons surgically treat arteries and veins in every part of the body except the brain and the heart.</p>

While vascular surgeons certainly can, and do, perform surgery, that is not the extent of their specialisation. Many vascular problems can also be treated with medication or exercise.</p>
                    <p>If you suffer from a long-term vascular disease, rest assured that you can trust the team at Venkataeswara Hospitals to look beyond surgery and keep your long-term health in mind when selecting the right treatment option for your needs.</p>

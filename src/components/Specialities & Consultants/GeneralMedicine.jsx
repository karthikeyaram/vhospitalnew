                                        <p>Our Primary Mission is to prevent the onset of lifestyle diseases which we believe are mostly predictable and preventable; especially Heart Attacks. Unfortunately, 99% of all people – including many HEALTH professionals! – are blissfully unaware of this. Our General Medicine Consultants are experienced not only at curing diseases but also at helping to prevent them.</p>

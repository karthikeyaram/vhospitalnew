                                        <p>We receive numerous Orthopaedic Trauma cases at Venkataeswara Hospitals, at all hours of the day – perhaps due to our proximity to Mount Road. Five orthopaedic specialists provide round-the-clock cover at the Hospital, performing all necessary emergency and routine orthopaedic procedures and surgeries for our patients, as indicated and required.</p>

                    <p>The Orthopaedic Surgery team routinely performs orthopaedic procedures including simple POP casting, closed and open reduction, fixation of fractures, DHS fixation of fractures (neck or femur), hip arthroplasty, total knee replacement, arthroscopic surgery, spinal surgery and treatment of sports injuries. Epidural injections of steroids are offered to help achieve pain relief for discogenic backaches, when the pain doesn’t reduce through administration of oral analgesics or physiotherapy treatments.</p>

                                        <p>Allergies and asthma, two conditions that usually occur together and affect the patient gravely. These two conditions have many symptoms and side effects in common.</p>
                                        <p>The same substance that may trigger your allergic reactions and symptoms, such as pollen dust, pet dander, etc., may also be the reason behind the appearance of asthma-related signs and symptoms. In some people, skin or food-related allergies may be instrumental in causing asthma symptoms. This condition can also be termed as allergic asthma or allergy-induced asthma.</p>

                    <h3>How can allergic reactions cause Asthma?</h3>
                    <p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance, such as pollen dust, or pet dander, as an external substance trying to cause harm to the body. In order to prevent your body from the substance, the immune system creates antibodies that bind to the allergen.</p>
                    <p>These chemicals affect the body and lead to allergic signs and symptoms, including nasal congestion, itchy eyes, skin reaction, etc. In some patients, these allergic reactions may also affect the lungs, causing asthma symptoms.</p>
                    <h3>Whoâ€™s at risk of allergic asthma?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Someone who has a family history of allergy is at an increased risk of developing allergic asthma.</li>
                        <li>Suffering from hay fever may also increase the risk of suffering from asthma.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Department of Allergy and Immunology at Venkataeswara Hospitals deals with the management of diseases and disorders that are related to the immune system. These may range from common to the rarest of the disorders, spanning across all ages and including numerous organs. Diseases that are treated by allergists/ immunologists are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eye infections, such as allergic conjunctivitis.</li>

                        <h3>Is allergy the only reason that causes asthma?</h3>
                        <p className='strongtag'>Allergic asthma is quite common, but not all asthmas are caused by allergies. Asthma may be caused due to varied kinds of triggers.
